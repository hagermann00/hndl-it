# Local AI Model Decision - hndl-it System

**USE MAXIMUM REASONING. STAKES ARE HIGH. Livelihoods depend on this.**

---

## CONTEXT

**Hardware:** RTX 2060 (12GB VRAM), i7-8700, 48GB RAM, 30TB Google Drive
**Tested:** 24GB effective (12GB VRAM + 12GB RAM offload) - stable

**Vision Model (Always Loaded):** Moondream 1.7GB
**Available for Brain:** ~8-10GB VRAM (or 20GB with offload)

**Revenue Targets:** $1,500/mo ASAP (survival), $5k+ ideal, $25k+ long-term
**Markets:** "The ones that are paying" - pure pragmatism

---

## THE PROJECT: hndl-it

Windows desktop automation with local-first AI:

- **Floater UI** - PyQt6 floating command interface
- **Browser Agent** - Pure CDP Chrome control
- **Desktop Agent** - Vision-based Windows automation
- **Vision Agent** - Moondream screenshot analysis

**Need:** A LOCAL BRAIN model that coordinates agents, outputs JSON commands, handles multi-step reasoning, runs CONCURRENTLY with Moondream.

## COMPETITION GAP

| Existing | Limitation | hndl-it Advantage |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| MCPControl | No vision | Local Moondream vision |
| Claude Computer Use | $$$, cloud | $0 local inference |
| Playwright | Heavy | Lightweight CDP |
| OpenInterpreter | No UI | Native Windows floater |

## THE QUESTION

**What local brain model(s) for an RTX 2060 12GB running concurrently with Moondream?**

**Consider:**

- Dense: Qwen2.5:7b/14b, Llama 3.1:8b, Mistral 7B, Phi-3
- MoE: Mixtral 8x7B (with offload), Qwen MoE
- Specialized: Hermes 2 Pro, Gorilla OpenFunctions
- Architecture: Single model vs dual (fast router + smart planner)

---

## DELIVER

1. **Primary Recommendation** - Model + VRAM math + reasoning
2. **2 Alternatives** - When to choose each
3. **Architecture** - Single vs multi-model
4. **Monetization Impact** - How model choice affects business
5. **Roadmap** - This week → This month → 3 months → 1 year
6. **Marching Orders** - Prioritized next steps

---

## MINDSETS TO ADDRESS

**A) Survival Mode:** Get it working NOW, monetize fast, perfection later
**B) Quality Foundation:** Build right first, slower revenue
**C) Hybrid Pragmatist:** MVP + iterate, balance survival and vision
